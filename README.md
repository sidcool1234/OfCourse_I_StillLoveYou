# OfCourse_I_StillLoveYou

I tried falling in love with Java again a few weeks back.  Got a solid enough start, but by the time
I reached Streams & Lambdas, it seemed arcane.  Why such complexity!  

Hence, I decided to go back to my newfound beau, Kotlin.  And specifically Kotlin for server side development.

So, here I go, a brand new start.  Wish me Luck.
